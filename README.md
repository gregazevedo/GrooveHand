GrooveHand
======
GrooveHand lets users control their lights and music with arm gestures--adjusting brightness and volume with a twist of the wrist, starting an instant party with some jazz fingers. We created two modes--music and light control that can be toggled with a flick of the wrist. Fan right to skip a song or change up your lighting colors, fan left to rewind or go back. GrooveHand gives users the ability to control their own entertainment with simple hand motions.
